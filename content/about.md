# About Me

Hi! I'm **Wilmar Monta√±o**, a Semi/Full-Stack Developer with a preference for backend development.

## What I Do

I work across the full stack, but I'm most comfortable diving deep into backend systems, APIs, databases, and server-side logic. While I can handle frontend work when needed, my passion lies in building robust, scalable backend solutions.

## Interests

Beyond coding, I have a deep interest in:

- **Electronics** - Building circuits and tinkering with hardware
- **Gaming** - Both playing and occasionally thinking about game development
- **Technology** - Always exploring new tools and frameworks

## This Blog

I created this space to share my thoughts on development, document interesting problems I solve, and write about the things I'm learning. Expect posts about backend development, electronics projects, and maybe some game-related content.

Feel free to explore my posts and reach out if you want to connect!
